# CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

## What's Running

```
vibepilot-governor.service (Go binary)
├── Polls Supabase every 1s
├── Max 8 concurrent per module, 160 total
├── Dynamic routing via config (NO hardcoded destinations)
├── Branch creation when Orchestrator assigns task
├── Reads secrets from vault at runtime
├── Startup recovery: finds and recovers orphaned sessions
├── Usage tracking: multi-window rate limit enforcement
├── Learning: model scoring RPC (ready to deploy)
├── Revision loop: max rounds configurable (default: 6)
├── Council execution: 3 members, parallel or sequential
└── Plan lifecycle: all states configurable via JSON
```

**Status:** `systemctl status vibepilot-governor`

## Architecture Principle

```
Model = Intelligence (thinks, outputs)
Transport/CLI = Provides tools natively (read/write/bash)
Destination = Where/how access happens (has capabilities)
Agent = Role with capabilities needed (for routing)
Prompt packet = Task + expected output format
Hat = Prompt/role a model wears for a specific task

Routing = config/routing.json (strategies, restrictions, categories)
Destinations = config/destinations.json (status, type, provides_tools)
Models = config/models.json (availability, access_via)
Plan Lifecycle = config/plan_lifecycle.json (states, transitions, rules)

NO HARDCODED DESTINATIONS. Everything configurable.
ALL CHANGES GO THROUGH TASK SYSTEM. Nothing implemented directly.
```

## Plan Lifecycle (NEW)

```
config/plan_lifecycle.json controls:
├── states: draft → review → [approved | revision_needed | council_review]
├── revision_rules: max_rounds (default: 6), on_max_rounds action
├── complexity_rules: simple vs complex detection thresholds
├── consensus_rules: unanimous_approval | majority | weighted
└── council_rules: member_count, lenses, parallel vs sequential strategy
```

## Event System (UPDATED)

| Event | Fires When | Handler Action |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| `EventPRDReady` | status = `draft` | Planner creates plan |
| `EventPlanReview` | status = `review` | Supervisor reviews |
| `EventRevisionNeeded` | status = `revision_needed` | Planner revises with feedback |
| `EventCouncilReview` | status = `council_review` | 3 council members review |
| `EventCouncilComplete` | council done | Consensus calculated |
| `EventPlanApproved` | status = `approved` (direct) | Tasks created |
| `EventPlanBlocked` | status = `blocked` | Awaits human |
| `EventPlanError` | status = `error` | Logged for recovery |

## Dynamic Routing

```
Event fires
    ↓
selectDestination(agentID, taskID, taskType)
    ↓
Get strategy for agent (internal_only for governance agents)
    ↓
Get priority order from routing.json
    ↓
For each category: find active destination
    ↓
Get model score from RPC (success_rate from task_runs)
    ↓
Return destination ID or "" if none available
```

**Internal agents (planner, supervisor, council, etc.)** → internal_only strategy → never external
**Task execution** → default strategy → external first, then internal

## "Hats" Concept

Models don't have fixed roles. Orchestrator assigns any available model to wear the appropriate "hat" (use the right prompt) for each task.

Example:
- Task needs maintenance work → Orchestrator picks available model → Model wears "maintenance hat"
- Task needs planning → Orchestrator picks available model → Model wears "planner hat"

## Codebase Structure (Clean)

## Bootstrap Keys (Secure)

| Key | Where It Lives | Who Can Read |
|-----|----------------|--------------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | `/etc/systemd/.../override.conf` | root only |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | `/etc/systemd/.../override.conf` | root only |
| `VAULT_KEY` | `/etc/systemd/.../override.conf` | root only |

**All other secrets** → Encrypted in Supabase `secrets_vault` table

**Read `docs/SECURITY_BOOTSTRAP.md` before touching credentials.**

- ✅ EventTestResults - Parse outcome, merge/reset/await based on result
- ✅ Context builder wired to planner and supervisor sessions
- ✅ PRD watcher wired to main.go

### DONE - Session 38 (Phase 1 & 2)

**Phase 1 - Critical Bug Fixes:**
- ✅ Migration 034: confidence/category columns, create_task_with_packet RPC
- ✅ Migration 035: update_plan_status sets plan_path
- ✅ Migration 036: revision_round, revision_history, council tracking
- ✅ config/plan_lifecycle.json: All plan rules configurable
- ✅ BUG FIX: Task creation failure → status = "error" (not "approved")
- ✅ BUG FIX: Council check before processing consensus
- ✅ Config loader: GetMaxRevisionRounds(), GetCouncilMemberCount(), etc.

**Phase 2 - Event Renaming & Revision Loop:**
- ✅ New events: EventRevisionNeeded, EventCouncilReview, EventCouncilComplete, EventPlanApproved, EventPlanBlocked, EventPlanError
- ✅ detectPlanEvents: Correct event firing based on status
- ✅ EventRevisionNeeded handler: Planner gets feedback, round limit enforced
- ✅ EventCouncilReview handler: 3 members, parallel/sequential, configurable
- ✅ EventPlanApproved handler: Direct approval creates tasks
- ✅ Consensus calculation: Uses config (unanimous_approval, majority, weighted)
- ✅ Council loads PRD for comparison (configurable)

### DONE - Session 39 (Bug Fixes)

**Critical Bug Fixes:**
- ✅ Fixed infinite task loop: EventTaskCompleted now properly handles supervisor decision
- ✅ Fixed branch checkout: Fetches from remote if branch not found locally
- ✅ Fixed JSON parsing: Handles both object arrays and string arrays for files_created
- ✅ Removed poe-web destination (web courier not implemented)
- ✅ Set stuck task T001 to 'escalated' status

**CRITICAL FIX - Prompt Packet Delivery:**
- ✅ Added `GetTaskPacket()` to DB package - fetches from `task_packets` table
- ✅ EventTaskAvailable now fetches prompt packet BEFORE execution
- ✅ Task runner receives full context: `prompt_packet`, `expected_output`, `context`
- ✅ Error handling for missing/empty packets (sets task to error)
- ✅ Category passed for routing consideration
- ✅ Agent hat now works - model receives instructions it can follow

**Task Validation + Feedback Loop:**
- ✅ Tasks validated at creation: confidence >= 0.95, non-empty prompt, category, expected output
- ✅ Validation failure → revision_needed (not error) with specific feedback
- ✅ Planner receives validation feedback via revision loop
- ✅ Supervisor rule recorded for learning (safety net catches missed issues)

### NEXT - Full Flow Test

| Priority | Task | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **TEST** | Full flow test | Create new PRD to test complete flow with prompt packets |
| **TEST** | Verify prompt delivery | Check logs show "prompt_len=N" where N > 0 |
| **TEST** | Council execution | Create complex PRD to trigger council |

| 035 | fix_plan_path.sql | ✅ Applied |
| 036 | revision_loop.sql | ✅ Applied |

## Key Principles

- **All changes go through task system** - Nothing implemented directly
- **Hats, not fixed roles** - Any model can wear any hat
- **Everything configurable** - Nothing hardcoded (max_rounds, member_count, etc.)
- **Everything learns** - All agents improve over time
- **Human reviews only** complex suggestions, API credit, UI/UX

---

## What NOT to Do

- Don't look for keys in `.env` (it's empty)
- Don't use Python code (it's in legacy/)
- Don't hardcode keys anywhere
- Don't hardcode destination IDs in code
- Don't hardcode routing logic in code
- Don't add TOOL: format back - it's gone for good
- Don't modify cleanup script without understanding cgroup logic
- Don't hardcode any defaults - everything in config files
- Don't implement anything directly - all changes through task system
- Don't hardcode revision rounds or council member counts - use config
