# VibePilot Current State

**Required reading: FOUR files**
1. **THIS FILE** (`CURRENT_STATE.md`) - What, where, how, current state
2. **`docs/GOVERNOR_HANDOFF.md`** - Full implementation details
3. **`docs/core_philosophy.md`** - Strategic mindset and principles
4. **`docs/prd_v1.4.md`** - Complete system specification

**Read all four → Know everything → Do anything**

# SESSION 33: SECURITY BOOTSTRAP FIX

## What Was Fixed

**Governor was using wrong env var for database key.**

### The Problem
- Go governor expected `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` 
- Python used `SUPABASE_KEY` (anon key)
- `.env` only had `SUPABASE_KEY`
- Systemd service used `EnvironmentFile=` (keys readable from files)

### The Fix
1. Changed Go to use `SUPABASE_KEY` (matches Python, works with RLS)
2. Removed `EnvironmentFile` from systemd service
3. Added `docs/SECURITY_BOOTSTRAP.md` documenting the architecture

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `governor/config/system.json` | `key_env: SUPABASE_KEY` |
| `governor/internal/runtime/config.go` | Default `KeyEnv: SUPABASE_KEY` |
| `governor/cmd/governor/main.go` | Error message updated |
| `scripts/governor.service` | Removed `EnvironmentFile` |
| `docs/SECURITY_BOOTSTRAP.md` | NEW - architecture documentation |

### Bootstrap Keys (from process environment, NEVER files)

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Database endpoint |
| `SUPABASE_KEY` | Anon key - reads from vault via RLS |
| `VAULT_KEY` | Decrypts secrets |

## SESSION 32: PRD → PLAN → REVIEW FLOW (IN PROGRESS)

## What Changed This Session

### 1. Fixed the PRD → Plan → Review Flow

The core flow now works correctly:

```
PRD in GitHub (docs/prds/*.md)
        ↓
    Plan created (status=draft)
        ↓
    Governor detects draft → EventPRDReady → Planner runs
        ↓
    Planner reads PRD → creates plan → saves to GitHub → status=review
        ↓
    Governor detects review → EventPlanReview → Supervisor runs
        ↓
    Supervisor reads PRD + plan → decides simple/complex
        ├── Simple → status=approved
        └── Complex → status=council_review → Council → approved
        ↓
    Approved → Tasks created from plan → Orchestrator assigns
```

### 2. Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `docs/supabase-schema/030_add_review_status.sql` | NEW - adds `review` status |
| `governor/config/system.json` | Added `plan_statuses_review: ["review"]` |
| `governor/config/agents.json` | Fixed tools for consultant, planner, supervisor |
| `prompts/planner.md` | Changed: save plan to GitHub, set status=review |
| `prompts/supervisor.md` | Added: Scenario 0 (initial plan review) |
| `governor/internal/runtime/config.go` | Added `PlanStatusesReview` field |
| `governor/internal/runtime/events.go` | Added `EventPlanReview`, `detectPlanReview()` |
| `governor/cmd/governor/main.go` | Added handler for `EventPlanReview` |
| `governor/internal/tools/db_tools.go` | Added `DBInsertTool` |
| `governor/internal/tools/registry.go` | Registered `db_insert` tool |
| `governor/config/tools.json` | Added `db_insert` tool definition |
| `governor/internal/destinations/runners.go` | Fixed NDJSON parsing for opencode |
| `governor/internal/destinations/courier.go` | NEW - courier runner implementation |

### 3. Agent Tools Fixed

| Agent | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| **Consultant** | `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `db_query`, `file_read`, `file_write` |
| **Planner** | `db_query`, `db_update`, `file_read`, `file_write` |
| **Supervisor** | `db_query`, `db_update`, `db_rpc`, `file_read` |

### 4. SQL Migrations Applied

| Migration | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| 029_plans_table.sql | ✅ Applied (Session 31) |
| 030_add_review_status.sql | ✅ Applied (Session 32) |

## Plan Status Flow

| Status | Meaning | Next Step |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `draft` | Planner is working | Planner saves plan, sets to `review` |
| `review` | Ready for Supervisor | Supervisor decides simple/complex |
| `council_review` | Complex, needs Council | Council reviews, reaches consensus |
| `revision_needed` | Council wants changes | Planner updates plan |
| `pending_human` | Awaiting human decision | Human approves/rejects |
| `approved` | Plan approved | Tasks created, Orchestrator assigns |
| `archived` | Plan archived | No action |

---

## Task Status Flow

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Created, waiting for plan approval |
| `pending_dependency` | Waiting on another task |
| `active` | Ready for assignment (was `available`) |
| `in_progress` | Assigned to agent |
| `review` | Done, awaiting supervisor review |
| `testing` | Tests running |
| `approval` | Tests passed, awaiting merge |
| `merged` | Complete |

---

## What's Working

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Governor builds | ✅ |
| Event detection (polling) | ✅ |
| PRD → Planner trigger | ✅ |

## FOR NEXT SESSION

**Read first:**
1. `CURRENT_STATE.md` (this file)
2. `docs/GOVERNOR_HANDOFF.md` (all implementation details)
3. `docs/core_philosophy.md` (strategic mindset)

**What to do:**
1. Test the full PRD → Plan → Review flow
2. Verify planner saves plan to GitHub correctly
3. Verify supervisor reads plan and makes decision
4. Implement task creation from approved plan
